# RostrosFisicosGatsby
A repository dedicated to the development of the Rostros Físicos website. Rostros Físicos is an outreach project dedicated to expanding upon the representation of Hispanic/Latinx-identifying peoples in physics by interviewing and creating videos about Hispanic/Latinx physicists at all points in the physics career trajectories.

## Background
This website was created using [GatsbyJS's](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) starter template ["gatsby-starter-hello-world"](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-hello-world). More templates, as well as many Gatsby tutorials and how-to guides, can be [found at this link on their website](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/starters/). [Another tutorial](https://whatjackhasmade.co.uk/using-a-csv-file-as-a-data-source-in-gatsby/)

## Repository Files
If a file is not listed, it is either a file that is generated by GatsbyJS, or in my use case I did not need to edit it.

## General Plan for Database Implementation

1) in the /src/data tab, a .csv file imported from Excel/Google Sheets will have entries that correspond to each person interviewed by Rostros Fisicos. Each row in the .csv is a "Person".
2) the createPages() routine, found in /gatbsy-node.js, creates a GraphQL query which reads the CSV, will extract the columns (pre-identified in the code) and then have each column set as a "node".
3) the createPages() routine will then 

## Multilingual Implementation
See these tutorials (in my order of preference):

([gatsby-plugin-translate plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/plugins/gatsby-plugin-translate/)) Compatible with GraphQL, which should be used in the implementation of the physicist database.

([manual implementation](https://betterprogramming.pub/multiple-language-websites-with-gatsbyjs-b4985746b9eb)). A more thorough implementation, but requires more manual coding and handling of createPages() methods and such.

| .gitignore      | this file is used to let know Git which files need to be ignored when pushing code to GitHub.      |
| gatsby-browser.js   | File used by Gatsby to implement global routines, I was using this for a global.css file but decided to have each type of page have its own .css file instead        |
| gatsby-config.js | This is where you will add your plugins and manually configure them |
| gatsby-node.js  | This is where the createPages() method is, and I usedd it to implement a template for each Person in the database, and then  |
